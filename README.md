# COVID-19 Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to uncover insights about confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different regions. The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling outliers, feature engineering, and correlation analysis. Additionally, an interactive dashboard was created using **Plotly** to facilitate dynamic exploration of the data.

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure accurate analysis, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Dealing with incomplete data to maintain dataset integrity.
2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Using IQR and Winsorizing to minimize the impact of extreme values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to enhance the dataset’s predictive power.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different attributes to extract key insights.

## Key Insights and Analysis
- The dataset was analyzed to determine trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths worldwide.
- The impact of COVID-19 on different **WHO regions** was examined.
- Visualization techniques were applied to highlight patterns and anomalies in the data.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into COVID-19 trends using data visualization and statistical analysis. The interactive **Plotly dashboard** enhances the user experience, making it easier to interpret and analyze the pandemic’s impact across different regions.
